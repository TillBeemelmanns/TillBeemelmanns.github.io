Hi, this is another blog about _AI_, _Computer Vision_ and _Machine Learning_. Currently, I am a research scientist at [RWTH Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de) with focus on AI and Automated Driving. 

I studied __Computational Engineering Science__ which combines __Math__, __Computer Science__ and __Engineering__.
